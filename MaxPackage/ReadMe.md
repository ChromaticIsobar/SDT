# Sound Design Toolkit (SDT): package for Max


## Overview
The **Sound Design Toolkit** (**SDT**) is an open-source (GPLv3) framework for
ecologically-founded sound synthesis and design. Think of it as a virtual
Foley-box!
It can simulate various acoustic phenomena arising from solid interactions
(e.g., impacts, frictions), liquids (e.g., bubbles, splashes), gasses (e.g.,
explosions, blowing wind), and machines (e.g., combustion engines, DC motors).
The library consists of sound synthesis models, audio processing algorithms and
analysis routines.

The SDT is mainly aimed at research and education in *Sonic Interaction Design*
(SID), but it's been successfully used in musical contexts as well.

The SDT sound synthesis algorithms have been implemented according to three main
points:
1. auditory perceptual relevance;
2. cartoonification, i.e. simplification and exaggeration of the underlying
physics in order to increase both computational efficiency and perceptual
clarity;
3. parametric temporal control, which ensures appropriate, natural and
expressive articulations of sonic processes.


## Implementation
In addition to this Max *package*, the SDT also comes in different flavors:
**C library** and **API** (suited to programmers of interactive media), and
**Pure Data** externals and patches for Mac, Windows and Linux.
